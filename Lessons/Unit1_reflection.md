# Unit 1 Reflection

## What worked well during unit 1?
Allocating a long time of the 
I think having an introduction of basic concepts using snakify was really great for me since my background in comp sci is very limitied worked really well
during project one, specially in the devolopmetn of my project and the completionof the tasks 


## What did not work well?
I think it would be better to have a bit more explanation during class, becuase although we can look it up in the learning log resources, I
think it would be helpful to optimize time outside of class.

## What did you enjoyed themost during porject unit 1?
Color coding, the overall development and seeing the oucome of my project is what I enjoyed the most. 

## What talent have you dicovered or practiced during this unit?

## What is working well in Computer Science for you?
I think during unit 1 the practice we had had, worked really well because I can see a big imporvement on my ability in using python. 
Allthough I still need a lot of work I do find it significant. I also think that the structure of the class works really well, something
ealse that worked well with the class was knowing the menu for the day which helps me understand the structure of the lesson a bit more.
Having time to complete the project and havig a deadline in my opinion with sufficient time since we got introduced the project is also
one of the things that worked the best during the unit.By far what worked the best for me was the amount of resources we could find in the 
learning log, because it helps me understqand new concepts and solve a lot of problems when revising or finishing solving my quizzes and tasks. 

## What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
